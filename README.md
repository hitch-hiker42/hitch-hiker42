Hi, I'm Jatin Khandual, a **Software Engineer** specializing in **Frontend Development** with solid **Backend** experience, a strong foundation in **Automation** and **Cloud Technologies**, and a passion for solving complex problems. I enjoy building scalable solutions that enhance both system performance and user experience.

### üíª Expertise
With around 3 years of experience, my primary focus is:
- **Frontend Development**: Specializing in **React**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript** to build responsive, intuitive UIs.
- **Backend Development**: Experience with **Node.js**, **gRPC**, and REST APIs to build reliable services.
- **Automation**: Built robust automation frameworks, improving feedback loops and release cycles.

I have also worked extensively with **AWS** services, contributing to cloud-based projects that improved system performance, monitoring, and scalability.

### üöÄ Key Projects
